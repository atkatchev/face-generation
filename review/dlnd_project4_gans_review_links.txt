Here there is a great video about GAN: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1mUN6dD8uE
I recommend checking the Google Python Style Guide, there are great tips about how to improve coding, in general: https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html

Original Paper on batch normalization: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03167.pdf

Beyond the intuitive reasons, there are good mathematical reasons why it helps the network learn better, too. It helps combat what the authors call internal covariate shift. This discussion is best handled in the paper and in Deep Learning(http://www.deeplearningbook.org) a book you can read online written by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. Specifically, check out the batch normalization section of Chapter 8: Optimization for Training Deep Models (http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/optimization.html).

Lowering the learning rate would require more epochs (in this project you are asked not to modify nb of epochs), but could ultimately achieve better accuracy.
beta1: about 0.5 see: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf (Student also reported good results with values like 0.2 or 0.3)
